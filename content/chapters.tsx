Have students draw or write down examples of situations where they've had to give consent in their daily lives on sticky notes. Then, create a consent wall where they can stick their notes and share their experiences with the group. This sets the stage for a lively discussion about the importance of consent and setting boundaries.",

            In this first chapter, we&apos;re diving into a topic called Consent
            and Healthy Boundaries. Consent is about every person having the
            right to choose what they are and are not comfortable with.
            It&apos;s giving permission and agreeing to something because it
            feels good and safe. We&apos;re going to explore how we give consent
            in our everyday lives and why it&apos;s important.

        facilitationNote: `Facilitation Tip: After watching the video, invite the students to create their own "boundary bracelets" using colorful beads or string. As they design their bracelets, encourage them to think about what boundaries mean to them and what makes them feel comfortable or uncomfortable. Facilitate a sharing circle where they can explain the significance of their bracelet designs and discuss how setting boundaries empowers them in their everyday lives. Emphasize the importance of enthusiastic consent and how setting boundaries protects their ability to give consent.`,

            Consent means giving permission with an enthusiastic YES! It&apos;s
            all about having the freedom to choose what feels right and
            comfortable for you, something we do every single day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether it&apos;s deciding who to play with or asking for a hug, we
            navigate a world of consent in lots of ways. But here&apos;s the
            deal: true consent is given with enthusiasm, not just to be polite.
            Discover the power of setting boundaries – like an invisible fence
            around you - to protect your ability to consent, both in person and
            online.

            In real life, it&apos;s obvious when someone is in a costume, but on

            even unsafe individuals posing as safe ones. Pay attention to the
            questions they ask and what they want you to do. If anything feels
            off or uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult. They can help you
            navigate the situation.

            that a &quot;no&quot; in person should also be a &quot;no&quot;

            Consent is all about freedom, and having the freedom to choose what
            you are and aren&apos;t comfortable with. In other words, giving
            permission. Real consent is expressing an enthusiastic YES, because
            anything less than a confident &quot;yes&quot; is a &quot;no.&quot;
            <br />
            <br />
            One way to know whether we are giving consent or just going along
            with something out of pressure is by paying attention to how our
            body feels. Listen to your gut and body; if it feels happy, relaxed,
            and excited, you&apos;re giving a genuine &quot;yes.&quot; This rule
            applies to technology too—always respect and give consent.

            Let&apos;s dive a bit deeper and bring what you&apos;ve learned into
            your personal life. Download or print this infographic and
            reflection page to contemplate your own personal boundaries.
            Consider how your body signals comfort or discomfort and reflect on
            how you communicate &quot;no.&quot; Remember, consent involves
            understanding both your own limits and being attuned to others&apos;
            feelings through body language and words. Think about creating a
            safe space for others to give consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            Congratulations! You finished the first Chapter on Consent & Healthy
            Boundaries! Keep going!

        description: `Exploitation is when someone takes advantage of someone else. Sexual exploitation, specifically for individuals under 18, occurs when someone takes advantage of another person sexually. By law, if you're under 18, you can't agree to any sexual activity if you receive something in return. Saying yes to sexual things just to fulfill your needs, like love, attention, or money, isn't genuine consent. It's crucial to remember that it's okay to have needs, but it's important to have them met in safe ways by safe people—ways that don't involve sexual activity.`,

            Navigating situations where we feel pressured, both in person and
            online, is tough, especially when we&apos;re offered something we
            want or need. It might seem okay, but being pushed into a situation
            where your needs are met only through a sexual act is not consensual
            and against the law, even online. But remember it also isn&apos;t
            your fault. True consent happens when you freely agree without any
            strings attached.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you ever feel unsure or pressured into something you&apos;re not
            comfortable with, please reach out to a trusted adult or one of
            these resources. If you are someone you know needs help, click on

            In this chapter we are going to be discussing a topic people
            don&apos;t typically talk about: Sexting. But what exactly is
            sexting? Sexting is when people exchange sexual messages, pictures,
            or videos using phones, tablets, or anything else online. This is
            important to know because sharing intimate images can get
            complicated and it is against the law if you&apos;re under a certain
            age. If someone does it because they feel pressured or in exchange
            for love or acceptance, it&apos;s called sexual exploitation.
            Let&apos;s navigate this subject together.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you ever need help because of sexting, there are many resources
            and trusted adults that will help. You are not alone.

            Just like we learned in Chapter 1, consent is our way of showing
            respect for each other&apos;s boundaries, both in person and online.
            We like to think of consent as our superhero shield, our superpower.
            But, here&apos;s the reality check: sharing or pressuring others
            without permission transforms our shield into a weapon. It breaks
            not only the superhero code but also the law. Our digital actions
            carry weight. Let&apos;s use our digital superpower wisely and be
            the superheroes championing respect.

            In this video, we&apos;ll explore a common scenario about sexting.
            Focus on two key factors in this video: consent and the law. Genuine
            consent means a clear and enthusiastic YES; if you ever feel uneasy
            or pressured, it&apos;s not true consent. Don&apos;t hesitate to set
            boundaries - a simple &quot;no&quot; is enough. Remember, it&apos;s
            against the law for anyone under 18 to send a nude, and those under
            12 cannot consent to any sexual activity. Sending a nude is
            considered a sexual act.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you ever feel pressured to send nudes or you&apos;re concerned
            about someone sharing an intimate image of you online, reach out to
            a trusted adult or one of these resources. You are not alone.

            problem: Sextortion. Think of it as digital blackmail. It happens
            when someone threatens to share your personal photos or information

            importantly, how to protect yourself and find support if you ever
            come across it. <br />

If this term is new to you, it means someone using another person to make money, either through unpaid work or selling their body. It's closely related to sexual exploitation. Let's dive into what human trafficking looks like and talk about how we can prevent it from happening to us or our friends.`,

            This is what we refer to as human trafficking - when individuals are
            manipulated into working without pay or engaging in sexual
            activities in exchange for money. It&apos;s a crime! If a friend, a
            romantic partner, a family member or an online account pressures you
            into doing something sexual, that&apos;s predatory. If they make
            money from it, it transforms into human trafficking, and that person
            would be called a human trafficker.
            <br />
            <br />
            Anyone can be trafficked, and anyone can be a trafficker. If you
            feel like this might be happening to you or someone you know, speak
            up and tell someone safe that you trust!

            Online interactions can be fun, but they can also be risky.
            Sextortion is a serious threat where someone might use your intimate
            photos against you to get what they want. Remember, it&apos;s never
            okay for someone to pressure you into sharing explicit images or
            videos. If you ever find yourself in this situation, stop
            communicating with the person, save all the information, and seek
            help from a trusted adult immediately.

            Sextortion is a serious crime that can have devastating
            consequences. It predominantly targets young males and involves
            coercing victims into sending sexual content, which is then used to
            blackmail them for money or more explicit material. Understanding
            the risks and knowing how to protect yourself online is crucial.
            Remember, if you ever experience sextortion, stop communicating with
            the perpetrator, save all evidence, and report it to the
            authorities.
